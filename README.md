# Sorting-Visualization

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. 

# Sorting Algorithms used

1.  bubble-sort 
2.  heap-sort
3.  insertion-sort
4.  merge-sort
5.  quick-sort
6.  selection-sort

# Implementation
